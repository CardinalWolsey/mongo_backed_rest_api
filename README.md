Mongo Backed REST API
==========================


Assignment Description
--------------------------
Create a single resource rest API with Express that's backed by Mongo.

I'm leaving this pretty open to interpretation. I want you to write this from scratch, don't just copy and paste code from class or previous projects.

Add a feature of Mongoose that we didn't use class, such as data validation.

Also, implement a non CRUD resource (meaning that it doesn't use the full GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE interface).
